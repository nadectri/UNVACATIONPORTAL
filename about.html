            The UN was established after World War II with the aim of <br>preventing future wars, succeeding the ineffective League of <br>Nations. On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San <br>
            Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, <br>which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 <br>
            October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the <br>Charter, the organization’s objectives include maintaining <br>
            international peace and security, protecting human rights, <br>delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable <br>
            development, and upholding international law. At its founding, <br>the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193, representing <br>
            the vast majority of the world’s sovereign states.

            The UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly; the <br>Security Council; the Economic and Social Council; the <br>
            Trusteeship Council; the International Court of Justice; and the <br>UN Secretariat. The UN System includes a multitude of <br>
            specialized agencies, such as the World Bank Group, the World <br>Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, <br>
            and UNICEF. Additionally, non-governmental organizations <br>may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other <br>agencies to participate in the UN’s work. The UN’s chief <br>
            administrative officer is the Secretary-General, currently <br>Portuguese politician and diplomat António Guterres since 1 <br>
            January 2017. The organization is financed by assessed and <br>voluntary contributions from its member states. The UN, its <br>
            officers, and its agencies have won many Nobel Peace Prizes, <br>
            though other evaluations of its effectiveness have been mixed. <br>Some commentators believe the organization to be an <br>
            important force for peace and human development, while <br>others have called it ineffective, biased, or corrupt.

            The organization’s mission to preserve world peace was <br>complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the <br>
            United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. Its <br>missions have consisted primarily of unarmed military <br>
            observers and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, <br>reporting and confidence-building roles. UN membership grew <br>
            significantly following widespread decolonization beginning in <br>the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained <br>
            independence, including 11 trust territories that had been <br>monitored by the Trusteeship Council. By the 1970s, the UN’s <br>
            budget for economic and social development programmes far <br>outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the <br>
            Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, <br>undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.
