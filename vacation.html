                may be authorized Home visit only on one condition.. this condition is when their Spouse  seeks for their vacation. <br>We wish to inform you that not all vacations are granted so you should not feel <br>
                discouraged when you try to apply for your Family/Friend or Loved one and it is rebuff because <br>the vacation department attends to so many people and yours might not be granted. So you <br>

                    If you apply for a vacation/invitation for someone, The UN needs to confirm your identity <br>before sending our officials out. And for that reason, If your identity could not be confirmed <br>
                        the UN will not approve the vacation. so you have to send your ID card, passport, Drivers <br>license or any means of identification.
                    Delay in payment and procrastination can also leads to the vacation cancellation. So to <br>avoid cancellation, You should write to the UN vacation department the reason for the delay <br>
                        in payment and you should give us a concrete date you will be making the payment so that <br>we can increase the time to wait for you .
                </div>

                We wish to let you know that the UN will respond to you in whatever language you used in <br>sending them a letter. <br>
                So we advise individuals who wants to apply for their loved one to send the letter with their <br>
                native language for a better understanding when the UN responds to you. You should not panic <br>
                to send letter to the UN with your native language because for as you know, The UN is a world <br>wide organization. <br>

                officials who leave the camp with vacation excuse and end up visiting harlots and were <br>eliminated by the ISIS because they failed to go home. The amendment of the policy has helped <br>
                a lot in the past 20 years because we have not lost our potential officials to the ISIS through <br>vacation process.
